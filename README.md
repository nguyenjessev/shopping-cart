# Shopping Cart

This is a simple shopping site demo built in Svelte

## Requirements

Build a site that has a homepage, a shop page, and a cart. Items can be added to
cart from the shopping page, and the cart will show all items and quantities
with a subtotal.

## What I used

Svelte, SvelteKit

## What I learned

Technically this assignment called for React, but I wanted to try to build
something in Svelte for my own enjoyment. I had to use the Svelte and SvelteKit
documentation in order to learn how to use the frameworks, but ultimately it was
all relatively easy. Svelte rocks!

I learned how to manage routes and layouts using Svelte, and I also had to use
stores and reactivity.
